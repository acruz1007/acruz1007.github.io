    <p>In this section of my Website you can find some "exhibits" that are meaningful to me!</p>

        <h2>Terry Foxs' Marathon Run</h2>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/canadaehx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13424504_web1_PRINT.SNA_.terry-fox.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1" width="450" alt="Marathon Runner">
        <p>This picture is meaningful to me because Terry Fox was a Canadian who ran for Cancer for 143 days straight with a prosthetic leg until cancer forced him to stop. He averaged a marathon per day, running a total of 3,339 miles. As a fellow Canadian, this is a historical event that I take pride in.</p>

        </audio>
        <p>This song is very meaningful to me because it's one of the very first worship songs that made me feel closer to God.</p>

      <p>Lucky was the first pet I ever owned. He lived for 9 years, before he passed away from intestinal issues. I loved him very much, and we created memories that I will cherish forever!</p>
