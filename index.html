    <p>Hello, World!</p>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Anthony Cruz. I'm a junior student-athlete here at Holy Cross College. I enjoy playing soccer and spending quality time with family and friends.</p>

    <section>
    <h1><mark>Anthony's Personal Blog</mark></h1>
    <p>Something that I really enjoy doing every summer is going to Smith Lake located in <strong>Arley, Alabama</strong>. Smith Lake is known for several things, but one of its main and unique characteristics is that it's a man made lake that <strong>flooded</strong> a town!
      That means there's currently a town below the lake, isn't that pretty <em>cool</em>? Every year, my girlfriend, her family, and I make several trips to Smith Lake because her Aunt owns a lake house right on the water. She also owns a black and blue 
      Malibu brand boat which is <em>astonishing</em>. It's about a 3 hour drive, but it's <em>so</em> worth it.<br>
      The views and weather at Smith Lake are <em>unreal</em>, especially during the summertime. It's the perfect place to get some sun, relax, release stress, and recharge. 
      The scenic views you get to see, with the sun shining, and all of the <em>beautiful</em> boats riding on the water, it's truly amazing. Some of the houses that you see along the lake front are <strong>out of this world!</strong> Were talking <em>millions of dollar houses</em>!
      Everytime we make a trip to Smith Lake we make the most of our time there since sometimes we're only there for a couple of days.

    <h2><u>What's there to do?</u></h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>We <em>love</em> to eat good traditional southern food.</li>
        <li>One of the main activities we do is wakesurfing. This is my <strong>absolute favorite!</strong> It's the one thing I look forward to the most every time we go to Smith lake because it's just <em>so much fun</em>!</li>
        <li>My girlfriend and I love to float on the water and just take in the sun.</li>
        <li>Her aunt always takes us on boat rides to give us a tour of the whole lake, which by the way, it's <em>very</em> big! Depending on water levels, it ranges from 500 to 713 miles.</li>
        <li>We always end the days by just having supper and winding down because by the end of it, we're all exhausted from the fun that was had.</li>
        <li>Some other activities you can do around town are hiking and visiting national parks. We've done both before and the hike to see a <em>huge</em> waterfall was so worth the leg pain!</li>
        <li>You can also go tubing on the water, knee boarding, and wakeboarding. They're all fun, but wakesurfing is <strong>unbeatable!</strong></li>
        <li>If you're feeling <em>frisky</em>, you can also go scoobadiving and explore the town located at the bottom of the lake</li>
        <li>If you want an <strong>adrenaline rush</strong> you can cliff jump, but be weary, you may <em>bust</em> an eardrum!!</li>
      </ul>
